# Best tutorials
## 2005
### HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL, Photoshop
This was one of my first ever full-stack website. The project presents a tutorials catalogue. As I have learned everything up until that point from online tutorials, I wanted to make these available for more interested people like myself.

### Features:
- Users can submit they're own tutorials
- Banner exchange script (very popular in that period)
- User doesn't need to leave website as every tutorial opens in a new tab/window and it is shown in an iframe (within the host website)
- Shoutbox (comment/message box)
- Statistics (track every tutorial opening)
- RSS Feeds
- Contact form
- Admin panel
